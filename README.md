# Image-Size-Reduction-and-Dimentionality-Reduction
Image size can be reduced using the K-means algorithm. K-means uses clustering to reduce the image size by grouping the similar properties together.
code for size reduction is available in k_means_clustering.ipynb
k-means.ipynb explains K-means algorithm with the help of other examples and graphical representation.
Image dimentionality can be reduced using the PCA algorithm.
code for size reduction is available in PCA.ipynb
